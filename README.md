## üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Creating a shipping calculator / plugin
It's really easy to [create a `ShippingCalculator` in Vendure](https://www.vendure.io/docs/typescript-api/shipping/shipping-calculator/) and this project takes advantage of it. You just need to create a new `ShippingCalculator` class that will inject in his init function, your `ShippingPackagesService` so that you can get which packages boxes to use in this order. You can get [here an example to how to do it](https://github.com/jonyw4/vendure-advanced-shipping/blob/master/packages/rodonaves/index.ts).
